# LDL-cholesterol-Friedewald-equation
Here's a complete Python code for calculating LDL cholesterol using the Friedewald equation.
In this code, the calculate_ldl_cholesterol function takes the total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol levels as input. It first checks if all the values are greater than zero. Then, it applies the Friedewald equation to calculate the LDL cholesterol level.

You can run this code and provide the total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol levels as input to get the estimated LDL cholesterol level based on the Friedewald equation.
